    "passage": "<p class=\"passage\">Urban heat islands occur when cities experience higher temperatures than nearby rural areas. Dense concentrations of buildings and pavement absorb and re-emit the sun's heat more than natural landscapes do. As climate change intensifies heat waves, many cities are seeking cost-effective strategies to reduce surface and air temperatures while improving residents' health.</p><p class=\"passage\">Expanding tree canopy is one widely recommended approach. Shade from mature trees can lower surrounding temperatures several degrees, reduce energy demand for cooling, and filter air pollutants. However, benefits are not evenly distributed. Neighborhoods with lower tree coverage often overlap with areas of economic disadvantage, where residents may face higher exposure to heat-related risks. Effective urban forestry programs therefore combine targeted planting, long-term maintenance plans, and community engagement to ensure trees survive and benefits persist.</p>",
    "questions": [
      {
        "q": "What is the primary cause of urban heat islands mentioned in the passage?",
        "options": ["Higher levels of greenhouse gases in cities", "Buildings and pavement absorbing and re-emitting heat", "Lack of rainfall in urban regions", "Increased traffic congestion"],
        "correct": 1,
        "explain": "The passage states that dense concentrations of buildings and pavement absorb and re-emit heat more than natural landscapes."

        "q": "Which benefit of expanding tree canopy is NOT mentioned?",
        "options": ["Lowering local temperatures", "Reducing air pollution", "Increasing biodiversity of soil microbes", "Reducing energy demand for cooling"],
        "correct": 2,
        "explain": "The text mentions temperature reduction, air filtering, and reduced energy demand. Soil microbe biodiversity is not discussed."

        "q": "Why are some communities more exposed to heat-related risks?",
        "options": ["They are located at higher elevations", "They have fewer parks but more lakes", "They have lower tree coverage and economic disadvantages", "They receive excessive rainfall"],
        "correct": 2,
        "explain": "The passage notes that low tree coverage often overlaps with economically disadvantaged areas, increasing exposure to heat."
