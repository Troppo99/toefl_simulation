    "passage": "<p class=\"passage\">Cities tend to be warmer than their surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island. Concrete and asphalt absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night, keeping temperatures elevated after sunset. Limited vegetation reduces shade and evapotranspiration, both of which naturally cool the air.</p><p class=\"passage\">Urban heat islands have consequences beyond discomfort. Higher nighttime temperatures increase energy demand for cooling, which can strain electrical grids during heat waves. They also worsen air quality, since stagnant, warm air fosters the formation of ground-level ozone. Vulnerable populations, including older adults and outdoor workers, face disproportionate health risks when extreme heat persists.</p><p class=\"passage\">Cities are experimenting with mitigation strategies. Planting street trees and expanding parks can lower neighborhood temperatures by several degrees. Cool roofs, which reflect more sunlight, and permeable, lighter-colored pavements help reduce heat absorption. Some municipalities encourage green roofs that add insulation and create habitats for pollinators. While no single solution eliminates heat islands, combining measures and targeting the hottest neighborhoods often yields the most meaningful benefits.</p>",
